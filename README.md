## Description
***

The Charanvir Network is an API for a social network web application. It works like most social network applications, where users can be created, updated and deleted. These users can create thoughts, which can also be updated and deleted, as well as reactions. 

The Charanvir Network utilizes Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the NoSQL database, and Mongoose for the ODM. The application is currently an API, with no working frontend, but there are plans in the future to create a responsive, mobile-friendly frontend for users to enjoy and communciate and share thoughts with their friends online.

```

This will initialize the node server and allow you to access the database. By following the API routes established in the project, you can perform CRUD for Users, Thoughts and Reactions. There is no working frontend for the project at the moment, so Insomnia or other similar programs can be used to test endpoints.
